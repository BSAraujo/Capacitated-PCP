The format of the CPCP instances from set S1 are organized as follows:

- First line contains the "number of nodes (n)", and the "maximum number of facilities to be opened (p)", respectively;
- Second line contains the distance values from node 0 to nodes 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, respectively.
- Third line contains the distance values from node 1 to nodes 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, respectively.
- (...)
- (n+1)-th line contains the distance values from node n-1 to nodes 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, respectively.
- (n+2)-th line contains the demand values for nodes 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, respectively.
- (n+3)-th line contains the capacity values for nodes 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, respectively.
